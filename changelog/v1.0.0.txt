## #Performance
- **Zero Locks**: Atomic operations eliminate mutex contention
- **MPSC Throughput**: 10x+ performance improvement under high concurrency
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic sync-to-MPSC transition based on contention
- **Lock-free Ring Buffer**: Power-of-2 sizing with CAS operations
- **Ownership Transfer**: Zero-copy optimization in MPSC mode
- **Adaptive Backpressure**: Intelligent buffer resizing under pressure
- **Time Cache**: High-performance time operations with millisecond resolution
- **Background Workers**: Asynchronous compression and cleanup operations

### Performance Characteristics
- **Sync Mode**: Direct writes with immediate durability
- **MPSC Mode**: Buffered writes with lock-free queue (1024-16384 entries)
- **Contention Detection**: Automatic scaling based on write competition
- **Buffer Policies**: Drop, fallback, or adaptive resize on overflow
- **Memory Safety**: Bounds checking and race condition prevention
- **GC Optimization**: Buffer pooling and ownership transfer reduce allocations

## #Architecture

### Zero-Lock Design
- **Atomic Operations**: All state managed with sync/atomic primitives
- **CAS Loops**: Compare-And-Swap for lock-free synchronization
- **Memory Ordering**: Proper memory barriers for cross-core consistency
- **Race Detection**: Clean race detector validation with -race flag

### MPSC Implementation

```

### Auto-scaling Algorithm
- **Contention Detection**: Monitor rotation flag during writes
